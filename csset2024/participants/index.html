        <!--<br>

        For the virtual symposium format, presenters are encouraged to think creatively about how to record and disseminate their research and scholarly endeavors as long as the minimum number of required media files are submitted. 
        
        <br>
      
        <br>

        For detailed instructions and resources on how to upload your presentation, please read the following information carefully.

        <b style="font-size:25px">Recording Your Presentation</b>

        <br>
        <br>

        We strongly encourage presenters to combine audio and visual elements for the recording (<b>a maximum of 10 minutes</b>) of their presentation to assist audience members during their viewing experience. 
        The best method to combine audio and visual elements is to add audio to presentation within PowerPoint and export the presentation as a video file.

        <b style="font-size:25px">Prepare Your Project Poster</b>

        <br>
        <br>

          

        General guidelines for posters can be found below. Please note that because the CSSET is in-person this year, students will need to submit their poster before due date to print posters for this event. 
        We recommend saving your poster as a PDF for the submission and we will print it for you. 

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Poster Development</b>

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your poster written with a lay, non-specialist audience in mind? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is there enough background/contextual information for a non-specialist to understand your work and its significance? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Did you discuss the implications of your research for your field and the community at large? 

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Proofing</b>

        <br>

        &emsp; * Did you proofread your poster, including the headings? 
        <br>
        &emsp; &emsp; Note: MS Word’s spell-check does not check any text that is in all caps, so you must do it yourself. Another great tool is to use Grammarly. 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Are all the special symbols, tables, and mathematical equations correctly displayed? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Are images properly embedded (not covering up text)? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your name (and the names of any co-authors) listed? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your program listed?

        <br>

        &emsp; * Did you include your title? 

        <br>
        <br>

        <b>Specifications</b>

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is the document orientation for your poster set to “portrait”? 

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your poster the correct size (24” X 36”)?

        <br>

        &emsp; * Is your file saved as a .pdf file? 

        <br>
        <br>

    <h2>CSSET 2021 Goes Virtual</h2>
    <p>
        Given the pandemic, in the interest of everyone&rsquo;s well being, the Organizing Committee will host CSSET 2021 virtually.
    </p>

    <h2>About CSSET</h2>
    <p>
        The Computer Science Symposium on Emerging Technologies (CSSET) 2021 is a university-wide event and aims at bringing the professors, researchers, and students 
        together in the fields of computer science, information systems, and cyber security to disseminate original research results, 
        and share new ideas and emerging technologies through practical development experience concentrating on both theory and practices.
        CSSET is also held to allow industry and government recruiters to reach out to computer science and computer & information security students at Marshall
        University for their hiring needs during busy seasons and to secure future talent with internships.
